# Turnur-Scanning-Project

Turnur has an unusually large number of wormholes for a known-space system, at on average about 10-12, which is 2/3 of what Thera has, but is considerably smaller. Some of the locals actively roll the NullSec holes, so there is almost always a signature to scan down.

The process of scanning and recording the Turnur wormholes is very similar to the Thera Scanning project. To avoid duplication, I would recommend reading [Thera Scanning Quick Start Guide](https://wiki.signalcartel.space/TS:Thera_Scanning_Quick_Start_Guide) and I will describe the differences below.

1. We have our own channel ***1420.Turnur*** 
2. We have our own Tripwire mask. **NOTE: Until we have a corp mask, please contact [Samari Arila Enaka](https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/440263795244269588) on Discord for access**
3. We have our own shared folder called ***Turnur Scanning***
4. We do not currently have a website, but I'm working on it

## Overview

1. Join the in-game "1420.Turnur" channel.
2. Connect to, and make online the "Turnur Scanning" shared folder. This is where you will add and remove bookmarks for the entry/exit holes. There is also a **Safe** subfolder with Insta-dock/undock bookmarks for Turnur and Isbrabata (nearest clone bay). A link to the folder can be found in the channels MOTD.
3. Connect to the Turnur shared mask in Tripwire and [adjust your settings](https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Thera_Scanning_Tripwire_Setup) (see Tripwire below for Turnur specific settings).
4. Use the [Thera Scan Tool](https://therascan.info/) to check the status of signatures in Thera
	1. Clear any expired signatures from Tripwire, and their bookmarks from the shared folder
		- **DO NOT** use the bookmarks section of the [Thera Scan Tool](https://therascan.info/) to highlight the bookmarks - it only works inside Thera. Manually look in the ***Turnur Scanning*** folder for the exit **AND** entry bookmark and remove them. **Double check** you have selected the correct bookmarks before deleting.
	2. Map any new signatures, save the bookmarks to the in-game ***Turnur Scanning*** folder, and then add them to Tripwire
		- **NOTE** As the [Thera Scan Tool](https://therascan.info/) was written for Thera, the incomming bookmark will say "Thera" (e.g. "ABC-123 Zoohen -> Thera") instead of Turnur. Make sure to change this to say Turnur.
5. *(Temporary logging for reports)* Count the different classes of exit systems and record [on this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OlDx9zuOy5cp6qiwP67WBPRdIkMcgeBMlbbRXH5o104/edit#gid=191857088) along with the date and time scanned
6. Any questions? Feel free to direct message [Samari Arila Enaka](https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/440263795244269588) on Discord. The [Thera Scan Tool](https://therascan.info/) walks you through the process, follow that and you shouldn't have any problems.
7. No gifts for contributing yet, but I am working on stocking ***Turnur II - Moon 5 - Republic Security Services Assembly Plant*** with ESRC supplies, and Alpha scanning ships if you need them.

## Tripwire

Tripwire is the mapping tool currently used by the Turnur project to record the connecting systems to Turnur. The required settings are very similar to **Thera Scanning Endeavor** but using a different mask.

Please follow the [Thera Scanning Tripwire Setup Guide](https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Thera_Scanning_Tripwire_Setup) replacing the "How do I setup the mask?" section with the instructions below:

1. Click Settings on the upper right of the Tripwire screen (the gears icon).
2. Expand the Account Settings menu.
3. Click the magnifying glass search icon, type "Turnur" into the mask name, selecting the Signal Cartel Turnur mask in the results. Click Add to add the mask to your settings.
4. Select the Turnur mask.
5. Click the save button.
6. Follow the remainder of the Thera Scanning Tripwire Setup Guide.
7. Please ensure when you have finished recording Turnur signatures, and plan to roam elsewhere that you switch to a different mask.
